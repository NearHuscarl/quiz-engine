# [Quiz Engine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/91)

### TODO

- Upload postman collection
- Add unit tests from hyperskill

### Remarks

- Quiz is owned by a user, but can be answered by any authenticated user.
- Only owner can delete their quizzes (duh!)
- Only correct answers are counted toward completion.
- Get all completions from a quiz means only get the attempts by current authenticated user.
